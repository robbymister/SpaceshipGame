# UnityGames
This repo includes multiple small Unity projects that I've worked on. For now this includes two versions of a very simple spaceship game (it doesn't work) and a working 2-player Pong game. For improvements, I'm trying to make the second Pong paddle driven by an AI that follows the ball around.
